# "Experience"
Seasoned architect of over-engineered side projects and half-documented APIs.  
Former chief visionary officer of "it worked on my machine."  
Currently leading an elite task force in merging conflicts without crying (too much).

## Currently Learning
- 🐍 Python (snake charming at scale)  
- 🗃️ SQL (teaching databases to spill their secrets)  
- 🌐 Django & Flask (web frameworks with personality)  
- ☕ Java & Spring Boot (brew once, deploy everywhere)  
- 🔗 n8n (because automating your automations is the real endgame)  
- 📜 JavaScript (still finding new ways to reinvent the wheel)  
- 🤖 ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch — machines teaching themselves to complain)  
- 📈 Tidyfun for functional data (yes, fun is mandatory for my thesis)  
- 🧩 Tidymodels for machine learning (statistical sorcery in R disguise)

## Tech Playground
🖥️ Mixing web dev stacks like cocktails nobody asked for  
🧠 Plotting ML experiments that may or may not overthrow humanity  
⚡ Automating workflows until even my coffee break is scripted  
☁️ Deploying things to "the cloud" (translation: someone else’s computer)   
☁️ Cloud alchemy with Docker & Kubernetes
